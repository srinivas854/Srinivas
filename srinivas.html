Children love stories. It’s true!
</p>
<p>
And every child enjoys it for different reasons – be it travelling to magical worlds, learning new concepts, going on adventures, etc.
</p>
<p>
Your child can join Tintin as he travels the world, solves mysteries and nabs crooks; your child can study at Hogwarts and learn about life through the magical world of Harry Potter; your child can go back in time and become an active participant at Akbar’s court.
